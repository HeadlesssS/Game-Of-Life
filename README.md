** I made this game in January 13 2025.**

#### Our Mathematics teacher had told us about this game and I was always amused by the implication of such a simple game, this is my shot at making the Game Of Life.

### The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life,
is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

#### You play by simply designing a shape and observing it's patterns. 
### The fun of the game is in trying to create shapes that never disappear or that move throught the space. And since this game is turing complete one could even fuly design an IC chip given the time,effort and perseverance.
You can find more info on the gliders, converters, spaceships or other shapes here:https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon

#### At each step in time of the game, the following transitions occur:</br>
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</br>
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</br>
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</br>
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

I have tried to give the game the classic vintage feeling it gave me when i played it.

### You can run the game by downloading the exe file nothing extra is required.
